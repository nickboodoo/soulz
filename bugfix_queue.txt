Long-Term Solution

Consider developing a more flexible screen management system that allows you to navigate 
    between different screens (such as inventory screens, battle screens, and dialog screens) 
    dynamically based on player input. This could involve a stack or queue to manage screen transitions, 
    ensuring that you can seamlessly move between using an item and returning to the battle without losing state.
