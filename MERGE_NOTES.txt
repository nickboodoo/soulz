LAST THING I DID BEFORE LEAVING:

BROUGHT IN CHARACTER, PLAYER, AND ENEMY AS PACKAGE

INSTANTIATED PLAYER OBJECT AS PLAYER IN SOULZ.PY MAIN

PASSED THAT PLAYER OBJECT AS A PARAMETER IN GAMEPLAYERMANAGER

INITIALIZED PLAYER WITHIN GAMEPLAYERMANAGER WITH SELF.PLAYER = PLAYER

NOW I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE PLAYER AND ALL OF ITS FUNCTIONS WITHIN GAMEPLAYERMANAGER
