# WELCOME TO SOULZ

## Soulz is a text-based rougue-lite game. I am happy to announced that I just released version 1.8 of Soulz.
In this game, you will embark on a journey through a mythical city where you will be able to kill enemies, collect a variety of loot and level up your character.\
See if you can beat the game on your first try by encountering the final boss and killing him!
