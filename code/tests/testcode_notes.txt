WHAT AM I DOING?

I am dynamically creating a world map from nodes and edges.

The edges are being used to assess difficulty.

Now I can assess the difficulty vs the dijkstra score  SO THAT I can make the shortest path more challenging for the player. 

I want this map to remain a tree THEREFORE it will not loop. In order to have gameplay longevity,
    I will allow backtracking through previously explored nodes. When the player chooses to backtrack, I will 
    make sure that the new battles they encounter will be way harder than the previous version of the same node. 
        

HOW DOES THIS AFFECT MAIN PROGRAM??
    I am not sure if a final boss is relevant anymore since, this will be more about the player making it to the end.
    Maybe I can have the final node be a boss fight. 
        Will need to see if this will be too challenging or not. 

    I will also need to figure out how to keep my "fast travel" functionality.
        Maybe I can work that fast travel feature into a menu or something. (?)
