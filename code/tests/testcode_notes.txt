def direct_path_exists(self, node_a, node_b):
    return node_b in [edge[0] for edge in self.edges.get(node_a, [])] or \
            node_a in [edge[0] for edge in self.edges.get(node_b, [])]

Returns true indicating a direct path exists in either direction between node_a and node_b and false otherwise.

Effectively checks for bidirectional direct connectivity between two nodes in the graph. 

If there's a path from node_a to node_b or from node_b to node_a, it returns True. 

This indicates that adding another edge between these two nodes could potentially create a circular path.
