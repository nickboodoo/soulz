Version 1.8 Release Notes:

1. The source code is now modularized into packages and modules.
2. The entire code base has been prepped for the development of Souls 2.0.
3. Added a new user interface functionality for a more pleasant user experience.
4. Polished almost all game mechanics including win/lose conditions.



SOULZ 2.0:

I will be focusing on converting my game loop by:
    removing the random encounter chance nonsense
        replacing this with a graph
        players will traverse through the graph
        encounters will be a function of weights (values)
            use dijkstra's algorithm to determine weights (values)
