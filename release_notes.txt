Version 1.5 Release Notes:

1. Completely reorganized the source code. New classes created: Character, Player, Enemy, BossBattle, BattleManager, WorldStates. 
    The main goal of breaking them down into their own classes were so that I can build on them in the future. 

2. Created new test directories where I unit test my code. 


SOULZ 2.0:

I will be focusing on converting my game loop by:
    removing the random encounter chance nonsense
        replacing this with a graph
        players will traverse through the graph
        encounters will be a function of weights (values)
            use dijkstra's algorithm to determine weights (values)
