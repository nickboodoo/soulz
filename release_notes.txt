SOULZ 2.0:

I will be focusing on converting my game loop by:
    removing the random encounter chance nonsense
        replacing this with a graph
        players will traverse through the graph
        encounters will be a function of weights (values)
            use dijkstra's algorithm to determine weights (values)
