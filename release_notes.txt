Version 1.5 Release Notes:

1. Completely reorganized the source code. New classes created: Character, Player, Enemy, BossBattle, BattleManager, WorldStates. 
    The main goal of breaking them down into their own classes were so that I can build on them in the future. 

2. Created new test directories where I unit test my code. 


SOULZ 2.0:

I will be focusing on converting my game loop by:
    removing the random encounter chance nonsense
        replacing this with a graph
        players will traverse through the graph
        encounters will be a function of weights (values)
            use dijkstra's algorithm to determine weights (values)

BUGS:

clear screen after user uses item (sucessful or not)

clear screen on final boss




TODO:

in live code
    change amount of health potions you can buy
    change explore and fast travel menuing so that it is faster to type

change ability to use ancient runestone
use sleep function for different print lines
show how many zinders you have in inventory

add repurcussion for evading the final boss


in testcode, write algorithm to generate graph so that i dont need hardcode
