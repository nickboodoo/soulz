Version 1.5 Release Notes:

1. Completely reorganized the source code. New classes created: Character, Player, Enemy, BossBattle, BattleManager, WorldStates. 
    The main goal of breaking them down into their own classes were so that I can build on them in the future. 

2. Created new test directories where I unit test my code. 


TODO:

- add dashes for better visibility
- show how many zinders the player has
    - show how much lifesteal
- make damage weighted
- also side note: zinders scaling is sort of op

- show level and character stats
- quest items show up in player inventory as a usable item but they cannot use it
