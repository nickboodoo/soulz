Version 1.5 Release Notes:

1. Completely reorganized the source code. New classes created: Character, Player, Enemy, BossBattle, BattleManager, WorldStates. 
    The main goal of breaking them down into their own classes were so that I can build on them in the future. 
2. Created new test directories where I unit test my code. 

3. Created a new UML Class diagram - which I will need to update again...
